\pnum
Paths define geometric objects which can be stroked (Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.surface.rendering.operations}), filled, and used to define a clip area (See: \ref{\iotwod.clipprops.intro}.

\pnum
A path contains zero or more figures.

\pnum
A figure is composed of at least one segment.

\pnum
A figure may contain degenerate segments. When a path is interpreted (\ref{\iotwod.paths.interpretation}), degenerate segments are removed from figures.
\begin{note}
If a path command exists or is inserted between segments, it's possible that points which might have compared equal will no longer compare equal as a result of interpretation (\ref{\iotwod.paths.interpretation}).
\end{note}

\pnum
Paths provide vector graphics functionality. As such they are particularly useful in situations where an application is intended to run on a variety of platforms whose output devices (\ref{\iotwod.displaysurface.intro}) span a large gamut of sizes, both in terms of measurement units and in terms of a horizontal and vertical pixel count, in that order.

\pnum
A \tcode{basic_interpreted_path} object is an immutable resource wrapper containing a path (\ref{\iotwod.pathgroup}). A \tcode{basic_interpreted_path} object is created by interpreting the path contained in a \tcode{basic_path_builder} object. It can also be default constructed, in which case the \tcode{basic_interpreted_path} object contains no figures.
\begin{note}
\tcode{basic_interpreted_path} objects provide significant optimization opportunities for implementations. Because they are immutable and opaque, they are intended to be used to store a path in the most efficient representation available.
