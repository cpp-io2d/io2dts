\pnum
Paths define geometric objects which can be stroked (Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.surface.rendering.operations}), filled, masked, and used to define a clip area (See: \ref{\iotwod.clipprops.summary}.

\pnum
A path contains zero or more figures.

\pnum
A figure is composed of at least one segment.

\pnum
A figure may contain degenerate segments. When a path is rendered in certain rendering and composing operations, degenerate segments can produce observable behavior.
\begin{example}
When a degenerate segment is rendered in a stroke rendering and composing operation (see \ref{\iotwod.surface.stroking}), the \tcode{line_cap} value contained in its \tcode{stroke_props} argument can result in a degenerate segment producing observable behavior in the form of a circle or square, or some variation thereof.
\end{example}

\pnum
Paths provide vector graphics functionality. As such they are particularly useful in situations where an application is intended to run on a variety of platforms whose output devices (\ref{\iotwod.displaysurface.intro}) span a large gamut of sizes, both in terms of measurement units and in terms of a horizontal and vertical pixel count, in that order.

\pnum
An \tcode{interpreted_path} object is an immutable resource wrapper containing a path (\ref{\iotwod.pathgroup}). An \tcode{interpreted_path} object is created by interpreting the path contained in a \tcode{path_builder} object. It can also be default constructed, in which case the \tcode{interpreted_path} object contains no figures.
\begin{note}
\tcode{interpreted_path} objects provide significant optimization opportunities for implementations. Because they are immutable and opaque, they are intended to be used to store a path in the most efficient representation available.
