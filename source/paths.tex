\pnum
Paths define geometric objects which can be stroked (Table~\ref{tab:surface.rendering.operations}), filled, masked, and used to define a Clip Area (\ref{clipprops.summary}.

\pnum
A path group contains zero or more paths.

\pnum
A path is composed of at least one path segment.

\pnum
A path may contain degenerate path segments. When a path is rendered in certain rendering and composing operations, degenerate path segments can produce observable behavior.
\begin{example}
When a degenerate path segment is rendered in a stroke rendering and composing operation (see \ref{surface.stroking}), the \tcode{line_cap} value contained in its \tcode{stroke_props} argument can result in a degenerate path segment producing observable behavior in the form of a circle or square, or some variation thereof.
\end{example}

\pnum
Paths provide vector graphics functionality. As such they are particularly useful in situations where an application is intended to run on a variety of platforms whose output devices (\ref{displaysurface.intro}) span a large gamut of sizes, both in terms of measurement units and in terms of a horizontal and vertical pixel count, in that order.
%
%\pnum
%For output devices, the measurement size of a pixel is determined by the physical size of the output device. Many output devices represent pixels as having the same horizontal and vertical measurement sizes. As such, when they display a rendered image which does not have the same horizontal to vertical pixel ratio as the output device, it 

\pnum
A \tcode{path_group} object is an immutable resource wrapper containing a path group (\ref{pathgroup}). A \tcode{path_group} object is created from the paths contained in a \tcode{path_builder} object. It can also be default constructed, in which case the \tcode{path_group} object contains no paths.
\begin{note}
\tcode{path_group} objects provide significant optimization opportunities for implementations due to being immutable and opaque.

%If the \underlyingrendandpresenttechs do not support lines or cubic \bezierlocal curves, Bresenham's algorithms and variations and improvements upon them allow computation of appropriate pixel values for these primitives.
