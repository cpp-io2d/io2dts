\rSec1 [\iotwod.surface.intro] {Surface class templates description}

\pnum
\indexlibrary{\idxcode{surface}}%
There are three \defn{surface class templates}:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{basic_image_surface}
\item \tcode{basic_output_surface}
\item \tcode{basic_unmanaged_output_surface}
\end{itemize}

\pnum
For ease of description, an instantiation of a surface class template will be called a \defn{surface}.

\pnum
A surface contains visual data and provides an interface for managing and manipulating that visual data.

\pnum
Surface class templates are \tcode{MoveConstructible} and \tcode{MoveAssignable}. They are neither \tcode{CopyConstructible} nor \tcode{CopyAssignable}. \begin{note}
On many platforms, especially those that use specialized hardware to accelerate various graphics operations, copying a surface is highly detrimental to performance and is rarely desired. The \tcode{copy_surface} function (\ref{\iotwod.standalone.copysurface}) exists for those situations where a copy is desired.
\end{note}

\pnum
The surface class templates manipulate visual data through rendering and composing operations.

\pnum
The rendering and composing operations \ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering} are described in terms of operating on each integral point of the visual data of a surface. The reason for that is to support the discrete nature of raster graphics data. Operating on each integral point of the surface is the coarsest granularity allowed. Implementations may perform rendering and composing operations at a finer granularity than that of each integral point.
\begin{note}
Vector graphics data, being continuous, has the finest granularity possible since it resolves at the limits imposed by the precision of the floating-point types used to determine its visual data at any particular point.
\end{note} 

\rSec1 [\iotwod.surface.rendering] {Rendering and composing}

\rSec2 [\iotwod.surface.rendering.ops] {Operations}

\pnum
The surface classes provide five fundamental rendering and composing operations:

 \\
\end{libreqtab2}

\pnum
All composing operations shall happen as-if in a linear color space, regardless of the color space of the visual data that is involved.

\pnum
\begin{note}
While a color space such as sRGB helps produce expected, consistent results when visual data are viewed by people, composing operations only produce expected results when the valid values for the color channel and alpha channel data in the visual data involved are uniformly (i.e. linearly) spaced. 
\end{note}

\rSec2 [\iotwod.surface.rendering.brushes] {Rendering and composing brushes}

\pnum
All rendering and composing operations use a \term{source brush} of type \tcode{basic_brush}.

\pnum
The masking operation uses a \term{mask brush} of type \tcode{basic_brush}.

\rSec2 [\iotwod.surface.rendering.sourcepath] {Rendering and composing source path}

\pnum
In addition to brushes (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.brushes}), the Stroke and Fill rendering and composing operations use a \term{source path}. The source path is either a \tcode{basic_path_builder<Allocator>} object or a \tcode{basic_interpreted_path} object. If it is a \tcode{basic_path_builder<Allocator>} object, it is interpreted (\ref{\iotwod.paths.interpretation}) before it is used as the source path.

\pnum
In addition to brushes, the Text Rendering rendering and composing operation uses a \term{source text} and a \tcode{font}. The source text is a \tcode{string} object containing text in the UTF-8 text format. The font is a \tcode{basic_font} object.

\rSec2 [\iotwod.surface.rendering.commonstate] {Common state data}

\pnum
All rendering and composing operations use the following state data:

\begin{libreqtab2}

\rSec2 [\iotwod.surface.rendering.specificstate] {Specific state data}

In addition to the common state data (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.commonstate}), certain rendering and composing operations use state data that is specific to each of them:

\rSec2 [\iotwod.surface.rendering.statedefaults] {State data default values}

\pnum
For all rendering and composing operations, the state data objects named above are provided using \tcode{optional<T>} class template arguments.

\pnum
If there is no contained value for a state data object, it is interpreted as-if the \tcode{optional<T>} argument contained a default constructed object of the relevant state data object.

\rSec1 [\iotwod.surface.coordinatespaces] {Standard coordinate spaces}

\pnum
There are four standard coordinate spaces relevant to the rendering and composing operations (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering}):
\begin{itemize}
\item the brush coordinate space;
\item the mask coordinate space;
\item the user coordinate space; and
\item the surface coordinate space.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The \term{brush coordinate space} is the standard coordinate space of the source brush (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.brushes}). Its transformation matrix is the brush properties' brush matrix (\ref{\iotwod.brushprops.summary}).

\pnum
The \term{mask coordinate space} is the standard coordinate space of the mask brush (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.brushes}). Its transformation matrix is the mask properties' mask matrix (\ref{\iotwod.maskprops.summary}).

\pnum
The \term{user coordinate space} is the standard coordinate space of \tcode{basic_interpreted_path} objects. Its transformation matrix is a default-constructed \tcode{basic_matrix_2d}.

\pnum
The \term{surface coordinate space} is the standard coordinate space of the surface object's visual data. Its transformation matrix is the surface properties' surface matrix (\ref{\iotwod.renderprops.intro}).

\pnum
Given a point \tcode{pt}, a brush coordinate space transformation matrix \tcode{bcsm}, a mask coordinate space transformation matrix \tcode{mcsm}, a user coordinate space transformation matrix \tcode{ucsm}, and a surface coordinate space transformation matrix \tcode{scsm}, the following table describes how to transform it from each of these standard coordinate spaces to the other standard coordinate spaces:

\rSec1 [\iotwod.surface.painting] {surface painting}

\pnum
When a painting operation is initiated on a surface, the implementation shall produce results as-if the following steps were performed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each integral point $sp$ of the surface's visual data, determine if $sp$ is within the clip area (\ref{\iotwod.clipprops.intro}); if so, proceed with the remaining steps.
\item Transform $sp$ from the surface coordinate space (\ref{\iotwod.surface.coordinatespaces}) to the brush coordinate space (Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.surface.pointtransforms.listing}), resulting in point $bp$.
\item Sample from point $bp$ of the source brush (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.brushes}), combine the resulting visual data with the visual data at point $sp$ in the surface's visual data in the manner specified by the surface's current \term{compositing operator} (\ref{\iotwod.renderprops.intro}), and modify the visual data of the surface at point $sp$ to reflect the result produced by application of the compositing operator.
\end{enumerate}

\rSec1 [\iotwod.surface.filling] {surface filling}

\pnum
When a filling operation is initiated on a surface, the implementation shall produce results as-if the following steps were performed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each integral point $sp$ of the surface's visual data, determine if $sp$ is within the \term{clip area} (\ref{\iotwod.clipprops.intro}); if so, proceed with the remaining steps.
\item Transform $sp$ from the surface coordinate space (\ref{\iotwod.surface.coordinatespaces}) to the user coordinate space (Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.surface.pointtransforms.listing}), resulting in point $up$.
\item Using the source path (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.sourcepath}), the fill rule (\ref{\iotwod.fillprops.intro}), and the antialiasing algorithm (\ref{\iotwod.fillprops.intro}), determine whether $up$ shall be filled; if so, proceed with the remaining steps.
\item Transform $up$ from the user coordinate space to the brush coordinate space (\ref{\iotwod.surface.coordinatespaces} and Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.surface.pointtransforms.listing}), resulting in point $bp$.
\item Sample from point $bp$ of the source brush (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.brushes}), combine the resulting visual data with the visual data at point $sp$ in the surface's visual data in the manner specified by the surface's current compositing operator (\ref{\iotwod.renderprops.intro}), apply the antialiasing algorithm if applicable, and modify the surface's visual data at point $sp$ to reflect the result produced by application of the compositing operator and antialiasing algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

\rSec1 [\iotwod.surface.stroking] {surface stroking}

\pnum
When a stroking operation is initiated on a surface, it is carried out for each figure in the source path (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering}).

\pnum
The following rules shall apply when a stroking operation is carried out on a figure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item No part of the surface's visual data that is outside of the clip area shall be modified.

\item The antialiasing algorithm (\ref{\iotwod.strokeprops.summary}) shall be used where applicable to determine whether a point along the path is rendered and if so what its resulting visual data is.

\item If the figure is a closed figure, then the point where the end point of its final segment meets the start point of the initial segment shall be rendered as specified by the \term{line join} value (see: \ref{\iotwod.strokeprops.summary} and \ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.specificstate}); otherwise the start point of the initial segment and end point of the final segment shall each by rendered as specified by the line cap value. The remaining meetings between successive end points and start points shall be rendered as specified by the line join value.

\item If the dash pattern (Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.surface.rendering.specificstate.listing}) has its default value or if its \tcode{vector<float>} member is empty, the segments shall be rendered as a continuous path.

\item If the dash pattern's \tcode{vector<float>} member contains only one value, that value shall be used to define a repeating pattern in which the path is shown then hidden. The ends of each shown portion of the path shall be rendered as specified by the line cap value.

\item If the dash pattern's \tcode{vector<float>} member contains two or more values, the values shall be used to define a pattern in which the figure is alternatively rendered then not rendered for the length specified by the value. The ends of each rendered portion of the figure shall be rendered as specified by the line cap value. If the dash pattern's \tcode{float} member, which specifies an offset value, is not \tcode{0.0f}, the meaning of its value is \impldefplain{dash pattern!offset value}. If a rendered portion of the figure overlaps a not rendered portion of the figure, the rendered portion shall be rendered.
\end{enumerate}

\pnum
When a stroking operation is carried out on a figure, the width of each rendered portion shall be the \term{line width} (see: \ref{\iotwod.strokeprops.summary} and \ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.specificstate}). Ideally this means that the diameter of the stroke at each rendered point should be equal to the line width. However, because there are an infinite number of points along each rendered portion, implementations may choose an \unspecnorm method of determining minimum distances between points along each rendered portion and the diameter of the stroke between those points shall be the same.
\begin{note}
This concept is sometimes referred to as a tolerance. It allows for a balance between precision and performance, especially in situations where the end result is in a non-exact format such as raster graphics data.
\end{note}

\pnum
After all figures in the path have been rendered but before the rendered result is composed to the surface's visual data, the rendered result shall be transformed from the user coordinate space (\ref{\iotwod.surface.coordinatespaces}) to the surface coordinate space (\ref{\iotwod.surface.coordinatespaces}).

\rSec1 [\iotwod.surface.masking] {surface masking}

\pnum
When a masking operation is initiated on a surface, the implementation shall produce results as-if the following steps were performed:

\begin{enumerate}
\item For each integral point $sp$ of the surface's visual data, determine if $sp$ is within the clip area (\ref{\iotwod.clipprops.intro}); if so, proceed with the remaining steps.
\item Transform $sp$ from the surface coordinate space (\ref{\iotwod.surface.coordinatespaces}) to the mask coordinate space (Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.surface.pointtransforms.listing}), resulting in point $mp$.
\item Sample the alpha channel from point $mp$ of the mask brush and store the result in $mac$; if the visual data format of the mask brush does not have an alpha channel, the value of $mac$ shall always be $1.0$.
\item Transform $sp$ from the surface coordinate space to the brush coordinate space, resulting in point $bp$.
\item Sample from point $bp$ of the source brush (\ref{\iotwod.surface.rendering.brushes}), combine the resulting visual data with the surface's visual data at point $sp$ in the manner specified by the surface's current compositing operator (\ref{\iotwod.renderprops.intro}), multiply each channel of the result produced by application of the compositing operator by $map$ if the visual data format of the surface's visual data is a premultiplied format and if not then just multiply the alpha channel of the result by $map$, and modify the surface's visual data at point $sp$ to reflect the multiplied result.
\end{enumerate}

\rSec1 [\iotwod.surface.textrendering] {surface text rendering}
\pnum
\begin{note}
The following uses terminology and other information contained in ISO/IEC 10646 and ISO/IEC 14496-22, both of which are listed in the normative references of this \documenttypename{}. 
\end{note}

\pnum
Text rendering is a complex subject. The specifics of how it is performed are described in ISO/IEC 10646 and ISO/IEC 14496-22. The following is an informative overview of the process. The normative process is described in those two standards, except where otherwise noted.

%\pnum
%When a text rendering operation is initiated on a surface, the implementation shall produce results as-if the following steps were performed:

\begin{enumerate}
%\item For each UCS character $ch$ resulting from the transformation of the source text from UTF-8 to UCS characters, use the font to determine the glyph or glyphs, $gl$, for the character.
\item This item is normative. The source text is transformed from UTF-8 to UCS characters.
\item This item is normative. The UCS characters are transformed into glyphs using the cmap table of the font. Where any characters do not map to glyphs, if the \tcode{basic_font} object's \term{merging} value is \tcode{true}, a font with a similar style (which should be determined using the OS/2 table's sFamilyClass value or in an \unspecnorm{} manner if that matching method fails to produce a result) that can make that mapping is selected and used for those characters. If no such font exists or if the \tcode{basic_font} object's \term{merging} value is \tcode{false}, the characters that do not map to glyphs are mapped to glyph index \tcode{0} as noted in the description of the cmap table.
\item That set of glyphs is then modified using transformations specified in various tables in the font, some of which are optional and thus may not be present, e.g. the GSUB table. Depending on the glyphs that are present in the set and the presence or absence of certain tables, it is possible that no modification will occur.
\item The layout of the glyphs for purposes of rasterization is calculated using metrics and adjustments specified in various tables in the font, some of which are optional, e.g. the BASE and GPOS tables.
\item This item is normative. When the text properties' location is a \tcode{basic_point_2d} object, the glyphs are rendered in a single line without regard to justification. When the location is a \tcode{basic_bounding_box} object, the glyphs are rendered in one or more lines, which are contained within the confines of the \tcode{basic_bounding_box} object.
\item If applicable, potential line break locations are determined.
\item This item is normative. The layout is modified as specified by the property values contained within the text properties.
\item If multiple lines are possible, the layout is modified to ensure that the rendered glyphs will fit within the specified bounds, adding line breaks where necessary and applying justification to each line.
\item This item is normative. Where the glyph data are contours or otherwise are composed of commands that resemble the figure items described in this \documenttypename, the glyphs shall be rendered and composed as-if this was a stroking operation, using the glyph data as the source path after applying any mathematical transformations necessary to convert the glyph data as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-22 into figure items as defined in this \documenttypename. Where the glyph data are raster graphics data, the glyphs shall be rendered and composed as-if this was a masking operation, with the glyph data serving as the mask brush and a \tcode{basic_mask_props} object default constructed with its wrap mode changed to \tcode{wrap_mode::none} serving as the mask properties. Regardless of how the glyph data are rendered and composed, the glyph data shall be transformed from its design space to surface coordinate space as specified in ISO/IEC 14496-22 suitably adjusted to conform to the layout. \begin{note}
The property values contained in the text properties have already been applied to the layout such that things like its font size and size units will be taken into account when transformation of glyph data from its design space to surface coordinate space occurs.
\end{note}
\end{enumerate}

\rSec1 [\iotwod.outputsurface.misc] {output surface miscellaneous behavior}

\pnum
What constitutes an \defn{output device} is \impldefplain{output device}, with the sole constraint being that an output device must allow the user to see the dynamically-updated contents of the display buffer.
\begin{example}
An output device might be a window in a windowing system environment or the usable screen area of a smart phone or tablet.
\end{example}

\pnum
Implementations may allow more than one \tcode{basic_output_surface} object, \tcode{basic_unmanaged_output_surface} object, or a combination thereof to exist and be displayed co-synchronously. \begin{note}
In windowing environments, implementations would likely support multiple objects of these types. In contrast, on a smart phone it is unlikely that an implementation would support multiple objects of these types due to environmental and platform constraints.
\end{note}

\pnum
It is not required that implementations support the existence of any \tcode{basic_unmanaged_output_surface} objects. See Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.graphsurf.surfs.requirementstab}.

\pnum
All functions that perform rendering and composing operations operate on the back buffer. The data is subsequently transfered to the display buffer as specified by the output surfaces.%<TODO> Specify on a per-function basis rather than with a blanket statement that is probably inaccurate.
