\rSec1 [displaysurface.intro] {\tcode{display_surface} Description}

\pnum
\indexlibrary{\idxcode{display_surface}}
The class \tcode{display_surface} derives from the \tcode{surface} class and provides an interface to a raster graphics data graphics resource called the \tcode{Back Buffer} and to a second raster graphics data graphics resource called the \tcode{Display Buffer}.

\pnum
The pixel data of the Display Buffer can never be accessed by the user except through a native handle, if one is provided. As such, its pixel format need not equate to any of the pixel formats described by the \tcode{experimental::io2d::format} enumerators. This is meant to give implementors more flexibility in trying to display the pixels of the Back Buffer in a way that is visually as close as possible to the colors of those pixels.

\pnum
The Draw Callback (Table~\ref{tab:displaysurface.state.listing}) is called by \tcode{display_surface::show} as required by the Refresh Rate and when otherwise needed by the implementation in order to update the pixel content of the Back Buffer.

\pnum
After each execution of the Draw Callback, the contents of the Back Buffer are transferred using sampling with an \unspecnorm filter to the Display Buffer. The Display Buffer is then shown to the user via the \term{output device}.
\enternote
The filter is \unspecnorm to allow implementations to achieve the best possible result, including by changing filters at runtime depending on factors such as whether scaling is required and by using specialty hardware if available, while maintaining a balance between quality and performance that the implementer deems acceptable.

In the absence of specialty hardware, implementers are encouraged to use a filter that is the equivalent of a nearest neighbor interpolation filter if no scaling is required and otherwise to use a filter that produces results that are at least as good as those that would be obtained by using a bilinear interpolation filter.
