\begin{note}
Input, such as keyboard, mouse, and touch, to user-visible surfaces will be added at a later date. This section is a placeholder. It is expected that input will be added via deriving from a user-visible surface. One possibility is that an \tcode{io_surface} class deriving from \tcode{display_surface}. This would allow developers to choose not to incur any additional costs of input support where the surface does not require user input.
