\pnum
Let \tcode{X} be a \graphicssurfacestemplparam type.

\pnum
The \tcode{X::additional_image_file_formats} class contains zero or more \tcode{image_file_format} enumerators that represent \impldefplain{additional data formats} additional data formats that the implementation can both construct an \tcode{image_surface} object from using the appropriate constructor and save an \tcode{image_surface} object to using \tcode{image_surface::save}. These are called \term{read/write image format enumerators}.

\pnum
The values of read/write image format enumerators shall be in the range \crange{10000}{19999}.

\pnum
The \tcode{X::additional_image_file_formats} class also contains the following nested classes:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \tcode{read_only}
\item \tcode{write_only}
\end{enumerate}

\pnum
The \tcode{additional_image_file_formats} class contains zero or more \tcode{image_file_format} enumerators that represent \impldefplain{additional read only data formats} additional data formats that the implementation can construct an \tcode{image_surface} object from using the appropriate constructor but cannot save an \tcode{image_surface} object to using \tcode{image_surface::save}. These are called \term{read only image format enumerators}.

\pnum
The values of read only image format enumerators shall be in the range \crange{20000}{29999}.

\pnum
The \tcode{additional_image_file_formats::write_only} class contains zero or more \tcode{image_file_format} enumerators that represent \impldefplain{additional write only data formats} additional data formats that the implementation can construct an \tcode{image_surface} object from using the appropriate constructor and save an \tcode{image_surface} object to using \tcode{image_surface::save} but cannot construct an \tcode{image_surface} object from using any constructor. These are called \term{write only image format enumerators}.

\pnum
The values of write only image format enumerators shall be in the range \crange{30000}{39999}.
