%The class \tcode{path_factory::path_close_path} describes a path instruction that affects the interpretation of a path factory's path group. It is described in terms of its effect on the evaluation of the path group. 
%
%\pnum
%If the current point in the path group contains a value. If it does, this instruction creates a line from the current point to the path group's last-move-to point. It then sets the path group's current point and last-move-to point to the value of the previous path geometry's last-move-to point.
%
%\pnum
%If there is no current point, then this operation does nothing.
%\enternote
%Because this operation does nothing if there is no current point, there is no need to track whether or not a path geometry has a valid last-move-to point. This operation is the only operation that uses the last-move-to point and all operations that establish a current point for a path geometry also establish a valid last-move-to point for that path geometry.
