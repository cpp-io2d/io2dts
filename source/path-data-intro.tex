\pnum
The classes in the \tcode{figure_items} namespace describe figure items.

\pnum
A figure begins with an \tcode{abs_new_figure} or \tcode{rel_new_figure} object. A figure ends when:

\begin{itemize}
\item a \tcode{close_figure} object is encountered;
\item a \tcode{abs_new_figure} or \tcode{rel_new_figure} object is encountered; or
\item there are no more figure items in the path.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The \tcode{path_builder} class is a sequential container that contains a path. It provides a simple interface for building a path but a path can be created using any container that stores \tcode{figure_items::figure_item} objects.
