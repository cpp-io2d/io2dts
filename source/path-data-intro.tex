\pnum
The classes in the \tcode{path_data} namespace describe path items.
%When used to define a path, the path items are interpreted sequentially starting with the first item.

\pnum
A path begins with an \tcode{abs_new_path} or \tcode{rel_new_path} object. A path ends when:

\begin{itemize}
\item a \tcode{close_path} object is encountered;
\item a \tcode{abs_new_path} or \tcode{rel_new_path} object is encountered; or
\item there are no more path items.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
The \tcode{path_builder} class is a sequential container that contains zero or more paths. It provides a simple interface for building a path group but a path group can be created using any container that stores \tcode{path_data::path_data_types} objects.
