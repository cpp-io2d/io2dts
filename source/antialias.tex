\pnum
The antialias enum class specifies the type of anti-aliasing that the rendering
system uses for rendering paths. See 
Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.antialias.meanings} for the meaning of each
\tcode{antialias} enumerator.

 \tcode{none}
 & No anti-aliasing is performed when performing a rendering operation.
 \\ \rowsep
 \tcode{fast}
 & Some form of anti-aliasing should be used when performing a rendering operation but performance is more important than the quality of the results. The technique used is \impldef{antialiasing!fast}.
 \\ \rowsep
 \tcode{good}
 & Some form of anti-aliasing should be used when performing a rendering operation and the sacrificing some performance to obtain better anti-aliasing results than would likely be obtained from \tcode{antialias::fast} is acceptable. The technique used is \impldef{antialiasing!good}.
 \\ \rowsep
 \tcode{best}
 & Some form of anti-aliasing should be used when performing a rendering operation and better anti-aliasing results than would likely be obtained from \tcode{antialias::fast} and \tcode{antialias::good} are desired even if performance degrades significantly. The technique used is \impldef{antialiasing!best}.
 \begin{note}
 This might commonly be chosen when a user is going to render something once and cache the results for repeated use or when a user is rendering something that does not necessarily need performance suitable for real-time computer graphics applications.
