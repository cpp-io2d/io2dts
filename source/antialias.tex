\pnum
The antialias enum class specifies the type of anti-aliasing that the rendering
system shall use for rendering text. See 
Table~\ref{tab:antialias.meanings} for the meaning of each
\tcode{antialias} enumerator.

 \tcode{default_antialias}
 & The meaning of this value is \impldef{antialiasing!default}.
 \\
 \tcode{none}
 & No anti-aliasing.
 \\
 \tcode{gray}
 & Monochromatic anti-aliasing.
 \enternote
 When rendering black text on a white background, this would produce gray-scale 
 \\
 \tcode{subpixel}
 & Anti-aliasing that breaks pixels into their constituent color channels and 
 manipulates those color channels individually. The meaning of this value for 
 any rendering operation other than \tcode{surface::show_text}, 
 \tcode{surface::show_glyphs}, and \tcode{surface::show_text_glyphs} is 
 \impldef{antialias!subpixel}.
 \\
 \tcode{fast}
 & The meaning of this value is \impldef{antialiasing!fast}. Implementations 
 shall enable some form of anti-aliasing when this option is selected.
 \enternote
 By choosing this value, the user is hinting that faster anti-aliasing is 
 preferable to better anti-aliasing.
 \exitnote
 \\
 \tcode{good}
 & The meaning of this value is \impldef{antialiasing!good}. Implementations 
 shall enable some form of anti-aliasing when this option is selected.
 \enternote
 By choosing this value, the user is hinting that sacrificing some performance 
 to obtain better anti-aliasing is acceptable but that performance is still a 
 concern.
 \\
 \tcode{best}
 & The meaning of this value is \impldef{antialiasing!best}. Implementations 
 shall enable some form of text anti-aliasing when this option is selected.
 \enternote
 By choosing this value, the user is hinting that better anti-aliasing is more 
 important than performance.
