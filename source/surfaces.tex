\rSec0 [surfaces] {Surfaces}

\pnum
Surfaces are composed of visual data, stored in a graphics data graphics resource.
\begin{note}
All well-defined \tcode{surface}-derived types are currently raster graphics data graphics resources with defined bounds. To allow for easier additions of future surface-derived types which are not composed of raster graphics data or do not have fixed bounds, such as a vector graphics-based surface, the less constrained term graphics data graphics resource is used.
\end{note}

\pnum
The surface's visual data is manipulated by rendering and composing operations (\ref{surface.rendering}).

\pnum
Surfaces are stateful objects.

\pnum
The various \tcode{surface}-derived classes each provide specific, unique functionality that enables a broad variety of 2D graphics operations to be accomplished efficiently.
