\indexdefn{standard coordinate space}%
\definition{standard coordinate space}{\iotwod.defns.stndcrdspace}
a Euclidean plane described by a Cartesian coordinate system where the first coordinate is measured along a horizontal axis, called the \xaxis, oriented from left to right, the second coordinate is measured along a vertical axis, called the \yaxis, oriented from top to bottom, and rotation of a point around the origin by a positive value expressed in radians is counterclockwise

\indexdefn{point}%
\definition{point}{\iotwod.defns.point}
\defncontext{point} coordinate designated by a floating point \xaxis{} value and a floating point \yaxis{} value within the standard coordinate space

\indexdefn{point}%
\definition{point}{\iotwod.defns.point.integral}
\defncontext{integral point} coordinate designated by an integral \xaxis{} value and an integral \yaxis{} value within the standard coordinate space

\indexdefn{normalize}%
\definition{normalize}{\iotwod.defns.normalize}
to map a closed set of evenly spaced values in the range $[0, x]$ to an evenly spaced sequence of floating point values in the range $[0, 1]$
\begin{note}
The definition of normalize given is the definition for normalizing unsigned input. Signed normalization, i.e. the mapping of a closed set of evenly spaced values in the range $[-x, x)$ to an evenly spaced sequence of floating point values in the range $[-1, 1]$, also exists but is not used in this \documenttypename{}.
\end{note}

\indexdefn{premultiplied format}%
\definition{premultiplied format}{\iotwod.defns.premultipliedformat}
format with color and alpha where each color channel is normalized and then multiplied by the normalized alpha channel value
\begin{example}
Given the 32-bit non-premultiplied RGBA pixel with 8 bits per channel \{255, 0, 
0, 127\} (half-transparent red), when normalized it would become \{1.0f, 0.0f, 
0.0f, 0.5f\}. As such, in premultiplied, normalized format it would become 
\{0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.5f\} as a result of multiplying each of the three color channels by the alpha channel value.
\end{example}

\indexdefn{visual data format}%
\definition{visual data format}{\iotwod.defns.visdatafmt}

%a specification of visual data channels which defines a total bit size for the format and each channel's role, bit size, and location relative to the upper (high-order) bit
%\begin{note}
%The total bit size may be larger than the sum of the bit sizes of the channels of the format.

\begin{note}
Even if the start point of the initial path segment and the end point of the final path segment are assigned the same coordinates, the path is still an open path since the final path segment's end point is not defined as being the start point of the initial segment but instead merely happens to have the same value as that point.
