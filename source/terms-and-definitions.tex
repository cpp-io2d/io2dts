\indexdefn{premultiplied format}%
\definition{premultiplied format}{\iotwod.defns.premultipliedformat}
visual data format with one or more color channels and an alpha channel where each color channel is normalized and then multiplied by the normalized alpha channel value
\begin{example}
Given the 32-bit non-premultiplied RGBA pixel with 8 bits per channel \{255, 0, 0, 127\} (half-transparent red), when normalized it would become \{1.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.5f\}. As such, in premultiplied, normalized format it would become \{0.5f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.5f\} as a result of multiplying each of the three color channels by the alpha channel value.
\end{example}

\definition{aliasing}{\iotwod.defns.alias}
presence of artifacts in the results of composing

\indexdefn{anti-aliasing}%
\definition{anti-aliasing}{\iotwod.defns.antialias}
application of a function or algorithm while composing to reduce aliasing
\begin{note}
Certain algorithms can produce ``better'' results, i.e. results with fewer artifacts or with less pronounced artifacts, when rendering text with anti-aliasing due to the nature of text rendering. As such, it often makes sense to provide the ability to choose one type of anti-aliasing for text rendering and another for all other rendering and to provide different sets of anti-aliasing types to choose from for each of the two operations.
