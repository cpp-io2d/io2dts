\indexdefn{standard coordinate space}
\definition{standard coordinate space}{\iotwod.defns.stndcrdspace}
a Euclidean plane described by a Cartesian coordinate system where the first coordinate is measured along a horizontal axis, called the \xaxis, oriented from left to right, the second coordinate is measured along a vertical axis, called the \yaxis, oriented from top to bottom, and rotation of a point around the origin by a positive value expressed in radians is clockwise

\indexdefn{visual data}
\definition{visual data}{\iotwod.defns.visdata}
data representing color, transparency, or some combination thereof

\indexdefn{channel}
\definition{channel}{\iotwod.defs.channel}
%a bounded set of homogeneously-spaced real numbers in the range $[0,1]$
a component of visual data with a defined bit size

\indexdefn{visual data format}
\definition{visual data format}{\iotwod.defns.visdatafmt}
a specification that defines a total bit size, a set of one or more channels, and each channel's role, bit size, and location relative to the upper (high-order) bit
%a specification of visual data channels which defines a total bit size for the format and each channel's role, bit size, and location relative to the upper (high-order) bit
%\enternote
%The total bit size may be larger than the sum of the bit sizes of the channels of the format.
%\exitnote

\indexdefn{visual data element}
\definition{visual data element}{\iotwod.defns.visdataelem}
an item of visual data with a defined visual data format

\indexdefn{alpha}
\definition{alpha}{\iotwod.defns.alpha}

% The following may not be needed. Already defined in IEC 60050 723-05-31
\indexdefn{pixel}
\definition{pixel}{\iotwod.defns.pixel}
a discrete, rectangular visual data element

\indexdefn{aliasing}
\definition{aliasing}{\iotwod.defns.alias}
the presence of visual artifacts in the results of rendering due to 
sampling imperfections

\indexdefn{artifact}
\definition{artifact}{\iotwod.defns.artifact}
an error in the results of the application of a composing operation 

\indexdefn{anti-aliasing}
\definition{anti-aliasing}{\iotwod.defns.antialias}
the application of a function or algorithm while composing to 
reduce aliasing
\enternote
Certain algorithms can produce ``better'' results, i.e. results with less 
artifacts or with less pronounced artifacts, when rendering text with 
anti-aliasing due to the nature of text rendering. As such, it often makes 
sense to provide the ability to choose one type of anti-aliasing for text 
rendering and another for all other rendering and to provide different sets of 
anti-aliasing types to choose from for each of the two operations.
\exitnote

\times P_{3}$ where t is in the range \crange{0}{1}, $P_{0}$ is the starting point, $P_{1}$

the ending point

\indexdefn{graphics resource}
\definition{graphics resource}{\iotwod.defns.graphicsresource}
<graphics resource> an object of unspecified type used by an implementation
\enternote
By its definition a graphics resource is an implementation detail. Often it will be a graphics subsystem object (e.g. a graphics device or a render target) or an aggregate composed of multiple graphics subsystem objects. However the only requirement placed upon a graphics resource is that the implementation is able to use it to provide the functionality required of the graphics resource.

\definition{premultiplied format}{\iotwod.defns.premultipliedformat}

multiplied by the normalized alpha channel value
\enterexample
Given the 32-bit non-premultiplied RGBA pixel with 8 bits per channel \{255, 0, 
0, 127\} (half-transparent red), when normalized it would become \{1.0, 0.0, 
0.0, 0.5\}. As such, in premultiplied, normalized format it would become \{0.5, 
0.0, 0.0, 0.5\} as a result of multiplying each of the three color channels by 
the alpha channel value.
