%\indexdefn{graphics resource}%
%\definition{graphics resource}{\iotwod.defns.graphicsresource}
%\defncontext{graphics resource} object of unspecified type used by an implementation
%\begin{note}
%By its definition a graphics resource is an implementation detail. Often it will be a graphics subsystem object (e.g. a graphics device or a render target) or an aggregate composed of multiple graphics subsystem objects. However the only requirement placed upon a graphics resource is that the implementation is able to use it to provide the functionality required of the graphics resource.

%\definition{composing operation}{\iotwod.defns.composingoperation}
%an operation that performs composing
%%an operation that uses a composition algorithm to combine part or all of a source of visual data capable of being treated as though it were a \pixmap with a \pixmap

%
%\indexdefn{sample}%

%
%\indexdefn{aliasing}%
%\definition{aliasing}{\iotwod.defns.alias}
%the presence of visual artifacts in the results of rendering due to 
%sampling imperfections
%
%\indexdefn{anti-aliasing}%
%\definition{anti-aliasing}{\iotwod.defns.antialias}
%the application of a function or algorithm while composing to 
%reduce aliasing
%\begin{note}
%Certain algorithms can produce ``better'' results, i.e. results with less artifacts or with less pronounced artifacts, when rendering text with anti-aliasing due to the nature of text rendering. As such, it often makes sense to provide the ability to choose one type of anti-aliasing for text rendering and another for all other rendering and to provide different sets of anti-aliasing types to choose from for each of the two operations.
