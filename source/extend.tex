\pnum
The \tcode{extend} enum class describes how a pixel's color should be 
determined if it is outside the boundary of the source \tcode{brush} or 
\tcode{surface} during a call to \tcode{surface::fill}, \tcode{surface::mask}, 
\tcode{surface::paint}, or \tcode{surface::stroke}.

\pnum
See Table~\ref{tab:\iotwod.extend.meanings} for the meaning of each \tcode{extend} enumerator.

 \tcode{none}
 & Any pixel outside of the bounds of the \tcode{brush} or \tcode{surface} 
 which is required to be set shall be set to transparent black.
 \\
 \tcode{repeat}
 & A pixel outside of the bounds of the \tcode{brush} or \tcode{surface} 
 which is required to be set shall be set to the color it would have been set to if the 
 \tcode{brush} or \tcode{surface} was infinitely large and repeated itself in 
 a left-to-right-left-to-right and top-to-bottom-top-to-bottom fashion.
 \\
 \tcode{reflect}
 & A pixel outside of the bounds of the \tcode{brush} or \tcode{surface} 
 which is required to be set shall be set to the color it would have been set to if the 
 \tcode{brush} or \tcode{surface} was infinitely large and repeated itself in 
 a left-to-right-to-left-to-right and top-to-bottom-to-top-to-bottom fashion.
 \\
 \tcode{pad}
 & A pixel outside of the bounds of the \tcode{brush} or \tcode{surface} 
 which is required to be set shall be set to the color of the nearest pixel that is in bounds.
