\pnum
\indextext{definitions|(}
For the purposes of this document, the following definitions apply.

\indexdefn{standard coordinate space}
\definition{standard coordinate space}{\iotwod.general.defns.standardcoordinatespace}
a Euclidean plane described by a Cartesian coordinate system where the first coordinate is measured along a horizontal axis, called the \xaxis, oriented from left to right, the second coordinate is measured along a vertical axis, called the \yaxis, oriented from top to bottom, and rotation of a point around the origin by a positive value expressed in radians is clockwise

\indexdefn{visual data}
\definition{visual data}{\iotwod.general.defns.visualdata}
data representing color, transparency, or some combination thereof

\indexdefn{channel}
\definition{channel}{\iotwod.general.defs.channel}
a bounded set of homogeneously-spaced real numbers in the range $[0,1]$

%\indexdefn{channel}
%\indexdefn{channel!color}
%\definition{color channel}{\iotwod.general.defns.colorchannel}
%a channel representing the intensity of a specific color
%
\indexdefn{visual data format}
\definition{visual data format}{\iotwod.general.defns.visualdataformat}
a specification of visual data channels which defines a total bit size for the format and each channel's role, bit size, and location relative to the upper (high-order) bit
\enternote
The total bit size may be larger than the sum of the bit sizes of all of the channels of the format.
\exitnote

\indexdefn{visual data element}
\definition{visual data element}{\iotwod.general.defns.visualdataelement}
an item of visual data with a defined visual data format

\indexdefn{alpha}
\definition{alpha}{\iotwod.general.defns.alpha}
visual data representing transparency

% The following may not be needed. Already defined in IEC 60050 723-05-31
\indexdefn{pixel}
\definition{pixel}{\iotwod.general.defns.pixel}
a discrete, rectangular visual data element

\indexdefn{aliasing}
\definition{aliasing}{\iotwod.general.defns.alias}
the presence of visual artifacts in the results of rendering due to 
sampling imperfections

\indexdefn{artifact}
\definition{artifact}{\iotwod.general.defns.artifact}
an error in the results of the application of a composing operation 

\indexdefn{anti-aliasing}
\definition{anti-aliasing}{\iotwod.general.defns.antialias}
the application of a function or algorithm while rendering to 
reduce aliasing
\enternote
Certain algorithms can produce ``better'' results, i.e. results with less 
artifacts or with less pronounced artifacts, when rendering text with 
anti-aliasing due to the nature of text rendering. As such, it often makes 
sense to provide the ability to choose one type of anti-aliasing for text 
rendering and another for all other rendering and to provide different sets of 
anti-aliasing types to choose from for each of the two operations.
\exitnote

% The following may not be needed. Already defined in IEC 60050 723-05-05.
\indexdefn{aspect ratio}
\definition{aspect ratio}{\iotwod.general.defns.aspectratio}
the ratio of the width to the height of a rectangular area

\indexdefn{color model}
\definition{color model}{\iotwod.general.defns.colormodel}
an ideal, mathematical representation of colors which often uses color channels

\indexdefn{additive color}
\definition{additive color}{\iotwod.general.defns.additivecolor}
a color defined by the emissive intensity of its color channels

\indexdefn{color model}
\indexdefn{color model!RGB}
\definition{RGB color model}{\iotwod.general.defns.rgbcolormodel}
an additive color model using red, green, and blue color channels

\indexdefn{color model}
\indexdefn{color model!RGBA}
\definition{RGBA color model}{\iotwod.general.defns.rgbacolormodel}
the RGB color model with an alpha channel
\enternote
RGBA is not a proper color model; it is a convenient way to refer to the RGB color model to which an alpha channel has been added.

The interpretation of the alpha channel and its effect on the interpretation of the RGB color channels is intentionally not defined here because it is context-dependent.
\exitnote

\indexdefn{color space}
\definition{color space}{\iotwod.general.defns.colorspace}
an unambiguous mapping of values to colorimetric colors
\enternote
The difference between a color model and a color space is often obscured, and sometimes the terms themselves are mistakenly used interchangeably.

A color model defines color mathematically without regard to how humans actually perceive color. Color models are useful for working with color computationally but, since they deal in ideal colors rather than perceived colors, they fail to provide the information necessary to allow for the uniform display of their colors on different output devices (e.g. LCD monitors, CRT TVs, and printers).

A color space, by contrast, maps unambiguous values to perceived colors. Since the perception of color varies from person to person, color spaces use the science of colorimetry to define those perceived colors in order to obtain uniformity. As such, the uniform display of the colors in a color space on different output devices is possible.
\exitnote

\indexdefn{color space}
\indexdefn{color space!sRGB}
\definition{sRGB color space}{\iotwod.general.defns.srgbcolorspace}
an additive color space defined in IEC 61966-2-1 that is based on the RGB color model

%\indexdefn{compose}
%\definition{compose}{\iotwod.general.defns.compose}
%to combine a source of raster graphics data with a raster graphics data graphics resource in the manner specified by a composition algorithm and store the result to the graphics resource
%\enternote
%The 'source of raster graphics' data may be the results of rendering or may be another raster graphics data graphics resource.
%
%Where a statement in the form 'compose X and Y' is encountered, X is the 'source of raster graphics data' and Y is the 'raster graphics data graphics resource'.
%\exitnote
%
\indexdefn{cubic \bezierlocal curve}
\definition{cubic \bezierlocal curve}{\iotwod.general.defns.cubicbezier}
a curve defined by the 
equation $f(t) = (1 - t)^{3} \times P_{0} + 3 \times t \times (1 - t)^{2} 
\times P_{1} + 3 \times t^{2} \times (1 - t) \times P_{2} + t^{3} \times P_{3}$ 
where $0.0 \le t \le 1.0$, $P_{0}$ is the starting point, $P_{1}$ is the first 
control point, $P_{2}$ is the second control point, and $P_{3}$ is the 
ending point

\indexdefn{quadratic \bezierlocal curve}
\definition{quadratic \bezierlocal curve}{\iotwod.general.defns.quadraticbezier}
a curve defined by the 
equation $f(t) = (1 - t)^{2} \times P_{0} + 2 \times t \times (1 - t) 
\times P_{1} + t^{2} \times (1 - t) \times P_{2}$ 
where $0.0 \le t \le 1.0$, $P_{0}$ is the starting point, $P_{1}$ is the 
control point, and $P_{2}$ is end point

\indexdefn{filter}
\definition{filter}{\iotwod.general.defns.filter}

\indexdefn{graphics data}
\definition{graphics data}{\iotwod.general.defns.graphicsdata}
<graphics data> visual data stored in an unspecified form

\indexdefn{graphics data}
\indexdefn{graphics data!raster}
\definition{graphics data}{\iotwod.general.defns.graphics.raster}
<raster graphics data> visual data stored as pixels that is accessible as if it was an array of rows of pixels beginning with the pixel at the integral point $(0,0)$

\indexdefn{graphics resource}
\definition{graphics resource}{\iotwod.general.defns.graphicsresource}
<graphics resource> an object of unspecified type used by an implementation
\enternote
By its definition a graphics resource is an implementation detail. Often it will be a graphics subsystem object (e.g. a graphics device or a render target) or an aggregate composed of multiple graphics subsystem objects. However the only requirement placed upon a graphics resource is that the implementation is able to use it to provide the functionality required of the graphics resource.
\exitnote

\indexdefn{graphics resource}
\indexdefn{graphics resource!graphics data graphics resource}
\definition{graphics resource}{\iotwod.general.defns.graphicsresource.graphicsdata}

\indexdefn{point}
\definition{point}{\iotwod.general.defns.point.integral}
<integral point> a coordinate designated by an integral \xaxis{} value and an integral \yaxis{} value within the standard coordinate space

\indexdefn{premultiplied format}
\definition{premultiplied format}{\iotwod.general.defns.premultipliedformat}

multiplied by the normalized alpha channel value
\enterexample
Given the 32-bit non-premultiplied RGBA pixel with 8 bits per channel \{255, 0, 
0, 127\} (half-transparent red), when normalized it would become \{1.0, 0.0, 
0.0, 0.5\}. As such, in premultiplied, normalized format it would become \{0.5, 
0.0, 0.0, 0.5\} as a result of multiplying each of the three color channels by 
the alpha channel value.
\exitexample

\indexdefn{graphics state data}
\definition{graphics state data}{\iotwod.general.defns.graphicsstatedata}
data which specify how some part of the process of rendering or of a composing operation shall be performed in part or in whole
