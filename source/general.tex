\rSec1[\iotwod.general.defns]{Terms and definitions}

\pnum
\indextext{definitions|(}
For the purposes of this document, the following definitions apply.

\indexdefn{aliasing}
\definition{aliasing}{\iotwod.general.defns.alias}
the presence of visual artifacts in the results of rendering due to 
sampling imperfections

\indexdefn{alpha}
\definition{alpha}{\iotwod.general.defns.alpha}
visual data representing transparency

\indexdefn{anti-aliasing}
\definition{anti-aliasing}{\iotwod.general.defns.antialias}
the application of a function or algorithm while rendering to 
reduce aliasing
\enternote
Certain algorithms can produce ``better'' results, i.e. results with less 
artifacts or with less pronounced artifacts, when rendering text with 
anti-aliasing due to the nature of text rendering. As such, it often makes 
sense to provide the ability to choose one type of anti-aliasing for text 
rendering and another for all other rendering and to provide different sets of 
anti-aliasing types to choose from for each of the two operations.

a path geometry with one or more path segments where the initial path segment's start point is not used to define the end point of the final path segment

Even if the start point of the initial path segment and the end point of the final path segment are assigned the same coordinates, the path geometry is still an open path geometry since the final path segment's end point is not defined as being the start point of the initial segment but instead merely happens to have the same value as that point.

In raster graphics a pixel is obtained by sampling visual data, whether 
electro-mechanically, e.g. by a digital camera when a picture is taken, or 
manually, e.g. by an artist using a raster graphics editing program to create a 
pixel representation of visual data; the given examples typically result in a 
texture composed of many pixels.

multiplied by the normalized alpha channel value
\enterexample
Given the 32-bit non-premultiplied RGBA pixel with 8 bits per channel \{255, 0, 
0, 127\} (half-transparent red), when normalized it would become \{1.0, 0.0, 
0.0, 0.5\}. As such, in premultiplied, normalized format it would become \{0.5, 
0.0, 0.0, 0.5\} as a result of multiplying each of the three color channels by 
the alpha channel value.

***FIXME*** (Is this even needed?)

\pnum
\enternote
By its definition a graphics resource is an implementation detail. Often it will be a graphics subsystem object (e.g. a graphics device or a render target) or an aggregate composed of multiple graphics subsystem objects. However the only requirement placed upon a graphics resource is that the implementation is able to use it to provide the functionality required of the graphics resource.
