\rSec1[\iotwod.general.defns]{Terms and definitions}

\pnum
\indextext{definitions|(}%
For the purposes of this document, the following definitions apply.

\indexdefn{aliasing}%
\definition{aliasing}{\iotwod.general.defns.alias}
<aliasing> the presence of visual artifacts in the results of rendering due to 
sampling imperfections

\indexdefn{anti-aliasing}%
\definition{anti-aliasing}{\iotwod.general.defns.anti.alias}
<anti-aliasing> the application of a function or algorithm while rendering to 
reduce aliasing

\indexdefn{artifact}
\definition{artifact}{\iotwod.general.defns.artifact}
<artifact> in signal processing, an error in the results due to the input 
signal and output signal not having a one-to-one mapping between their 
frequencies

\indexdefn{B\'ezier curve}
\definition{B\'ezier curve}{\iotwod.general.defns.bezier}
<B\'ezier curve> a curve defined by a parametric equation where the starting 
point, ending point, and zero or more control points are given -- a cubic 
B\'ezier curve, which is the type meant whenever the general term B\'ezier 
curve is used herein, has two control points and is defined by the following 
equation: $f(t) = (1 - t)^{3} \times P_{0} + 3 \times t \times (1 - t)^{2} 
\times P_{1} + 3 \times t^{2} \times (1 - t) \times P_{2} + t^{3} \times P_{3}$ 
where $0.0 \le t \le 1.0$, $P_{0}$ is the starting point, $P_{1}$ is the first 
control point, and $P_{2}$ is the second control point, and $P_{3}$ is the 
ending 
point
\enternote
$f(t) = P_{0}$ when $t = 0.0$ and $f(t) = P_{3}$ when $t = 1.0$
\exitnote

\indexdefn{coordinate space}
\definition{coordinate space}{\iotwod.general.defns.coordinate.space}
<coordinate space> used to define specific positions on a surface; when a 
surface is displayed or otherwise rendered, the point (0.0, 0.0) is the top 
left, the positive X axis extends rightward, the positive Y axis extends 
downward, the point (1.0, 0.0) rotated around the point (0.0, 0.0) to $0$ 
radians will be at (1.0, 0.0), the point (1.0, 0.0) rotated around the point 
(0.0, 0.0) to $\frac{(\pi)}{(2.0)}$ radians will be at (0.0, 1.0), the point 
(1.0, 0.0) rotated around the point (0.0, 0.0) to $\pi$ radians will be at 
(-1.0, 0.0), the point (1.0, 0.0) rotated around the point (0.0, 0.0) to 
$\frac{(3.0 \times \pi)}{(2.0)}$ radians will be at (0.0, -1.0), and the point 
(1.0, 0.0) rotated around the point (0.0, 0.0) to $2.0 \times \pi$ 
radians will be at (0.0, 1.0)

\indexdefn{filter}
\definition{filter}{\iotwod.general.defns.filter}
<filter> a mathematical function that transforms a signal into discrete data

\indexdefn{graphics}
\indexdefn{graphics!raster}
\definition{graphics}{\iotwod.general.defns.graphics.raster}
<raster graphics> visual information stored as a rectangular grid of pixels

\indexdefn{graphics}
\indexdefn{graphics!vector}
\definition{graphics}{\iotwod.general.defns.graphics.vector}
<vector graphics> visual information stored as geometrical data

\indexdefn{pixel}
\definition{pixel}{\iotwod.general.defns.pixel}
<pixel> a discrete data element with a format-dependent composition
\enternote
In raster graphics a pixel is obtained by sampling visual data, whether 
electro-mechanically, e.g. by a digital camera when a picture is taken, or 
manually, e.g. by an artist using a raster graphics editing program to create a 
pixel representation of visual data; the given examples typically result in a 
texture composed of many pixels
\exitnote

\indexdefn{point}
\definition{point}{\iotwod.general.defns.point}
<point> a coordinate designated by an X component and a Y component within the 
coordinate space of a surface

\indexdefn{render}
\definition{render}{\iotwod.general.defns.render}
<render> the process of compositing source data and destination data to create 
result data that replaces the destination data
\enternote
depending on the compositing operator and the clip, there may not be any change 
to the original destination data.
\exitnote

\indexdefn{sampling}%
\definition{sampling}{\iotwod.general.defns.sampling}
<sampling> the transformation of continuous or discrete signals to discrete 
data by application of a filter

\indexdefn{signal}
\indexdefn{signal!continuous}
\definition{signal}{\iotwod.general.defns.signal.cont}
<continuous signal> a real function which is defined at every point within a 
2D space and conveys information about one or more properties of the space

\indexdefn{signal}
\indexdefn{signal!discrete}
\definition{signal}{\iotwod.general.defns.signal}
<discrete signal> a real function which is defined at points separated by 
integer intervals within a 2D space and conveys information about one or more 
properties of the space

The \Cpp  programming language as described in this International
Standard is based on the language as described in Chapter R (Reference
Manual) of Stroustrup: \doccite{The \Cpp  Programming Language} (second
edition, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, ISBN 0-201-53992-6,
copyright \copyright 1991 AT\&T). That, in turn, is based on the C
programming language as described in Appendix A of Kernighan and
Ritchie: \doccite{The C Programming Language} (Prentice-Hall, 1978, ISBN
