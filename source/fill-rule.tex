\pnum
The \tcode{fill_rule} enum class determines how the Filling operation (\ref{surface.filling}) is performed on a path group.

\pnum
For each point, draw a ray from that point to infinity which does not pass through the start point or end point of any non-degenerate path segment in the path group, is not tangent to any non-degenerate path segment in the path group, and is not coincident with any non-degenerate path segment in the path group.

\pnum
See Table~\ref{tab:fillrule.meanings} for the meaning of each \tcode{fill_rule} enumerator.

 \tcode{winding}
 & If the Fill Type (Table~\ref{tab:surface.state.listing}) is \tcode{fill_type::winding}, then using the ray described above and beginning with a count of zero, add one to the count each time a non-degenerate path segment crosses the ray going left-to-right from its begin point to its end point, and subtract one each time a non-degenerate path segment crosses the ray going from right-to-left from its begin point to its end point. If the resulting count is zero after all non-degenerate path segments that cross the ray have been evaluated, the point shall not be filled; otherwise the point shall be filled.
 \\
 \tcode{even_odd}
 & If the Fill Type is \tcode{fill_type::even_odd}, then using the ray described above and beginning with a count of zero, add one to the count each time a non-degenerate path segment crosses the ray. If the resulting count is an odd number after all non-degenerate path segments that cross the ray have been evaluated, the point shall be filled; otherwise the point shall not be filled.
 \enternote
 Mathematically, zero is an even number, not an odd number.
