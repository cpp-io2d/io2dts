\rSec0 [brushes] {Brushes}

\pnum
Brushes serve as sources of visual data for composing operations.

There are four types of brushes:
\begin{itemize}
	\item color;
	\item linear gradient;
	\item radial gradient; and,
	\item surface.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
A brush has its own coordinate space (\ref{surface.coordinatespaces}), which is by default the standard coordinate space. It is controlled by a \tcode{matrix_2d} value.

\pnum
It possesses a \tcode{filter} value and a \tcode{tiling} value, which combine to determine the visual data value returned when a composing operation samples a brush.

\pnum
The \tcode{filter} value determines the value returned by a brush when a composing operation samples a brush. When the visual data of the brush is a pixmap and the point the composing operation requests does not directly correspond to the exact coordinate of a pixel within the pixmap, the \tcode{filter} value is used to determine the value of the visual data that is returned. If the visual data of the brush is not a pixmap, the \tcode{filter} value is irrelevant.

\pnum
The \tcode{tiling} value controls what happens when a composing operation needs to sample from a point that is outside of the bounds of the brush.

%\pnum
%Excluding brushes created using a \tcode{solid_color_brush_factory} object, brushes produce very different composing operation results depending on the values of their mutable state.
%

\pnum
Color brushes produce the same sampling result regardless of their coordinate space, \tcode{filter}, and \tcode{tiling}. They are unbounded and as such always produce the \tcode{rgba_color} value they were created with when sampled from, regardless of the requested point.

\pnum
Linear gradient and radial gradient brushes share similarities with each other that are not shared by the other types of brushes. This is discussed in more detail below (\ref{gradients}).

\pnum
Surface brushes take an \tcode{image_surface} object and use it as the source of the brush's visual data.
