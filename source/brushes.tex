\rSec0 [brushes] {Brushes}

\pnum
Brushes serve as sources of visual data for composing operations.

\pnum
A brush has its own coordinate space (by default the standard coordinate space).

\pnum
It possesses a \tcode{filter} value and a \tcode{tiling} value, which combine to determine the visual data value returned when a composing operation samples a brush.

\pnum
The \tcode{filter} value determines the value returned by a brush when a composing operation samples a brush. When the visual data of the brush is a pixmap and the point the composing operation requests does not directly correspond to the exact coordinate of a pixel within the pixmap, the \tcode{filter} value is used to determine the value of the visual data that is returned. If the visual data of the brush is not a pixmap, the \tcode{filter} value is irrelevant.

\pnum
The \tcode{tiling} value controls what happens when a composing operation needs to sample from a point that is outside of the bounds of the brush.

\pnum
A brush is created using one of four factory classes:
\begin{itemize}
\item \tcode{solid_color_brush_factory},
\item \tcode{linear_brush_factory},
\item \tcode{radial_brush_factory}, and
\item \tcode{surface_brush_factory}.
\end{itemize}

\pnum
Excluding brushes created using a \tcode{solid_color_brush_factory} object, brushes produce very different composing operation results depending on the values of their mutable state.

\pnum
Brushes created using either a \tcode{linear_brush_factory} object or a \tcode{radial_brush_factory} object are considered to be gradient brushes. They share similarities with each other that are not shared by brushes created using the other brush factories. This is discussed in more detail below (\ref{gradients}).
