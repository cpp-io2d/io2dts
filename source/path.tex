\rSec0 [pathgroup] {Class \tcode{path_group}}

\pnum
\indexlibrary{\idxcode{path_group}}
The class \tcode{path_group} contains the result of processing \ref{paths.processing} a \tcode{path_factory} object. How it stores the resulting data is \unspec.

\pnum
A \tcode{path_group} object is used by a \tcode{surface}-derived object for rendering and composing operations.

\pnum
The contents of a \tcode{path_group} object are immutable, however the contents it contains are changeable using copy assignment or move assignment.

\pnum
A \tcode{path_group} object can be default constructed. Default construction of a \tcode{path_group} object produces the same result as constructing it from an empty \tcode{path_factory} object.
%
%\pnum
%When a \tcode{path} object is set on a \tcode{surface} object using 
%\tcode{surface::path}, the geometric paths represented by it can be 
%stroked or filled.

%\pnum
%A \tcode{path} object shall be usable with any \tcode{surface} or \tcode{surface}-derived object.

	\pnum
	\effects
	Constructs an object of class \tcode{path_group}. When a \tcode{path_group} object is used by a \tcode{surface}-derived object, it shall produce the same result as if its contents were constructed by processing the \tcode{path_factory} object as specified at \ref{paths.processing}.

	\pnum
	\throws
	As specified in Error reporting (\ref{\iotwod.err.report}).

	\pnum
	\remarks
	A \tcode{path_group} object may require further processing by the graphics subsystem when it is passed as an argument to a \tcode{surface} or \tcode{surface}-derived object.
	
	\pnum
	Implementations should avoid or minimize the need for further processing of a \tcode{path_group} object after it has been constructed.

	\pnum
	\errors
	\tcode{errc::not_enough_memory} if there was a failure to allocate memory.
	
	\pnum
	\tcode{io2d_error::no_current_point} if, when processing the path group of the \tcode{path_factory}, an operation was encountered which required a current point the current point had no value.
	
	\pnum
	\tcode{io2d_error::invalid_matrix} if, when processing path group of the \tcode{path_factory}, an operation was encountered which required the current transformation matrix to be invertible and the matrix was not invertible.
	
	\pnum
	\tcode{io2d_error::invalid_status} if the implementation or graphics subsystem encountered an error other than those specified above.
