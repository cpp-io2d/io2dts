%%%%% Rename path to path_group so that a path group contains paths rather than path geometries. Rework all working accordingly and eliminate "sub path" since it is now just "path".
\pnum
\indexlibrary{\idxcode{path}}
The class \tcode{path} contains a path geometry graphics resource that is usable with a \tcode{surface}-derived object.

\pnum
A \tcode{path} object is constructed from the path geometry collection data of a \tcode{path_factory} object. The path geometries of its path geometry graphics resource are immutable, however its path geometry graphics resource can be changed using copy assignment or move assignment.

\pnum
An \tcode{path} object can be default constructed. Default construction of a \tcode{path} object results in a \tcode{path} object which has a path geometry graphics resource that contains no path geometries.

\pnum
When a \tcode{path} object is set on a \tcode{surface} object using 
\tcode{surface::path}, the geometric paths represented by it can be 
stroked or filled.

%\pnum
%A \tcode{path} object shall be usable with any \tcode{surface} or \tcode{surface}-derived object.

	\pnum
	\effects
	Constructs an object of class \tcode{path}. Implementations shall create a path geometry graphics resource from the path geometries contained in \tcode{pb.data_ref()} as if they followed the procedure set forth in \ref{pathgeometries.processing}.

	\pnum
	\throws
	As specified in Error reporting (\ref{\iotwod.err.report}).

	\pnum
	\remarks
	It is unspecified whether a \tcode{path} object shall require further processing when it is passed as an argument to a \tcode{surface} or \tcode{surface}-derived object.
	
	\pnum
	Implementations should avoid or minimize the need for further processing of a \tcode{path} object after it has been constructed.

	\pnum
	\errors
	\tcode{errc::not_enough_memory} if there was a failure to allocate memory.
	
%	\pnum
%	\tcode{io2d_error::no_current_point} if, when processing the path geometries, an operation was encountered which required a current point and the current path geometry had no current point.
%	
%	\pnum
%	\tcode{io2d_error::invalid_matrix} if, when processing the path geometries, an operation was encountered which required the current transformation matrix to be invertible and the matrix was not invertible.
