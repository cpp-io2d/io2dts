\rSec2 [\iotwod.req.native] {Native handles}

\pnum
Several classes described in this Technical Specification have members 
\tcode{native_handle_type} and \tcode{native_handle}. The presence of these 
members and their semantics is \impldef{presence and meaning of 
\tcode{native_handle_type} and \tcode{native_handle}}.
\enternote
These members allow implementations to provide access to implementation 
details. Their names are specified to facilitate portable compile-time 
detection. Actual use of these members is inherently non-portable.
