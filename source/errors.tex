\rSec0[\iotwod.err.report]{Error reporting}

\pnum
2D graphics library functions often provide two overloads, one that throws an exception to report graphics subsystem errors, and another that sets an \tcode{error_code}.

\pnum
\enternote
This supports two common use cases:

\begin{itemize}
\item Uses where graphics subsystem errors are truly exceptional and indicate a serious failure. Throwing an exception is the most appropriate response. This is the preferred default for most everyday programming.

\item Uses where graphics subsystem errors are routine and do not necessarily represent failure. Returning an error code is the most appropriate response. This allows application specific error handling, including simply ignoring the error.
\end{itemize}

\exitnote

\pnum
Functions \textbf{not} having an argument of type \tcode{error_code\&} report errors as follows, unless otherwise specified:

\begin{itemize}
\item When a call by the implementation **FIXME**
\end{itemize}
